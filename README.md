 <h2>🚀 Dan's Portfolio 🚀</h2>

Hi! I'm Dan, a graduate of the Northcoders coding bootcamp, currently looking for work in my first development role.

🏗

<h1> 🛠️ Skillsets 🛠️ </h1>

<b>⚛️ React.js</b> - Also focused in Northcoders. <br/>
<b>🦋 Flutter</b> - Used in our final project. <br/>
<b>🔥 Firebase</b> - As above! <br/>
<b>🐱 Git</b> - Where we are now! <br/>
<b>🌐 HTML/CSS</b> - Practiced outside of Northcoders. <br/>
<b>📋 SQL</b> - Needed for database stuff! <br/>


<h1>✨ Projects ✨</h1>

A collection of my projects from Northcoders and after!

<a href="https://github.com/Root-2/SquadLight-Flutter"><h3>Squadlight</h3></a>
My final project with @Northcoders - Using Firebase, Flutter, and React, this is a rough draft of an application to help small groups of friends track one another.

<a href="https://github.com/Root-2/TerraformingMarsManual"><h3>Terraforming Mars Online Manual</h3></a>
My CSS and HTML styling practice project, recreating a board game manual as a webpage.

<a href="https://github.com/Root-2/FS-NC-News"><h3>NC News</h3></a>
An older project - done before much training or practice in CSS, so it's a touch of an ugly duckling! <br/>
Uses React as a single-page site with login functions, using an API to call a backend for articles and comments.<br/>

<h1>💡 Things I'm Up To 💡</h1>

Tidying up the above projects, and producing a full-stack project outside of Northcoders.<br/>
Also working on a portfolio website to better display my projects!<br/>
