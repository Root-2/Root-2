Hi! I'm Dan, a graduate of the Northcoders coding bootcamp, currently working at ENSEK Nottingham in an SQL-focused role within their Billing deparment.


<h1> 🛠️ Skillsets 🛠️ </h1>

<h1>✨ Projects ✨</h1>

A collection of my projects from Northcoders:

<a href="https://github.com/Root-2/SquadLight-Flutter"><h3>Squadlight</h3></a>
My final project with @Northcoders - Using Firebase, Flutter, and React, this is a rough draft of an application to help small groups of friends track one another.

<a href="https://github.com/Root-2/FS-NC-News"><h3>NC News</h3></a>
An older project - done before much training or practice in CSS, so it's a touch of an ugly duckling! <br/>
Uses React as a single-page site with login functions, using an API to call a backend for articles and comments.<br/>

<h1>💡 Things I'm Up To 💡</h1>

At ENSEK, handling energy bills on their Ignition platform, and learning to write SQL scripts to automate and handle the workload.<br/>
